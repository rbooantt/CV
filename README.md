Here I will drop some of the projects that I found to be the most interesting during the course of my degree, especially those which involve programming skills. As os right now, I only have a few projects about web scraping and machine learning. But in the near future I hope that I can upload more projects like the Final Degree Project. The program I usually work with is Google Collaborate but I have also used Spyder, always in a Python environment. Shared with Gitfront.io
