Here I will drop some of the projects that I found to be the most interesting during the course of my degree. 

Análisis y predicción de los precios de las viviendas en la ciudad de Madrid.pdf -> This file contains the Final Degree Project which consists of an analysis and prediction of housing prices in the city of Madrid. It is an exhaustive work that uses machine learning techniques, especially supervised learning to train a model that accurately predicts housing prices, and unsupervised learning to cluster the houses. 
- In the supervised learning task, several models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and SVM are considered.
- In the unsupervised learning, we use the hierarchical agglomerative algorithm to determine the number of groups and the k-means algorithm to understand the characteristics of each group.

Trabajo_Fin_Grado_LU.html -> This file is a Jupyter Notebook transformed to html, which contains all the activities that are carried out during the Final Degree Project. 

Practica_1_MD.ipynb -> This file contains an analysis and prediction of data from a telecommunications company, for which we aim to predict whether the customer will acquire a product using machine learning models.
