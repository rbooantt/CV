Here I will drop some of the projects that I found to be the most interesting during the course of my degree, especially those which involve programming skills. As os right now, I only have a few projects about web scraping and machine learning, but in the near future I hope that I can upload more projects like the Final Degree Project. The program I usually work with is Google Collaborate but I have also used Spyder in a Python environment. 

Practica_1_MD.ipynb -> This file contains an analysis and prediction of data from a telecommunications company, for which we aim to predict whether the customer will acquire a product using machine learning models

Practica_2_MD.ipynb -> This file contains an extract, transform, and load (ETL) activity for data from a housing portal. In this case, we aim to predict the price of a specific property in the city of Madrid using supervised learning models. We also obtain a new grouping of the properties through unsupervised learning techniques such as clustering.
