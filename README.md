Hello there visitor, in this repository I will drop some of the projects that I have found to be the most interesting in my career.

**Calculadora Precios Viviendas** -> This file is a URL that contains a tool for predicting housing prices in the city of Madrid (Spain) based on a series of characteristics. This web is the realization of my final degree project, bringing it to life and making it useful. It can be used for numerous purposes and I believe it is worth to take a look at it. If you are interested in how I made it, check out the **TFG.ipynb** file. 

**TFG.ipynb** -> This file contains the Final Degree Project which consists of an analysis and prediction of housing prices in the city of Madrid. It is an exhaustive work that uses machine learning techniques, especially supervised learning to train a model that accurately predicts housing prices, and unsupervised learning to cluster the houses into a new set of groups with unique characteristics. 
- In the supervised learning task, I considered several models such as **Random Forest**, **Gradient Boosting** and **SVM**.
- In the unsupervised learning task, I used the **hierarchical agglomerative algorithm** to determine the number of groups and the **k-means algorithm** to understand the characteristics of each group.
This file is a Jupyter Notebook which contains all the activities that are carried out during the Final Degree Project, which includes **ETL** (Extract, Load and Transformation), **EDA** (Exploratory Data Analysis), **Data Preprocessing**, **Supervised Learning** and **Unsupervised Learning**. 

**Practica_1_Data_Mining.ipynb** -> This file is a Jupyter Notebook which contains an analysis of data from a telecommunications company, for which we aim to predict whether a customer will acquire a product using machine learning models.
